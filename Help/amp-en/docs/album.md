# The album management dialog

This dialog allows you to delete, rename and add albums into the [amp# database](data_storing.md). The dialog can be accessed via the [main window file menu](main_window.md#album).

Albums can be renamed, added and deleted using this dialog. Deleting albums never deletes any tracks from the [amp# database](data_storing.md). The default album **can not** be deleted.
