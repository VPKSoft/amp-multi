# Saved queues dialog
In the saved queues dialog saved queues can be modified and loaded to the track list. The queue snapshots are sort of mini playlists inside an album of tracks. 

To create a queue simply add songs to the queue in the track list and then save the queue from the [Queue](main_window.md#the-queue-menu) menu. Queues can also be created during playback using the alternate queue which is not modified by the playback.

In the *Saved queues* dialog a queue can be:

* Deleted using the delete button

* *Append to queue* button loads the queue after the current queue to the album
* *Insert to queue start* button inserts the selected queue on top of the current queue to the album and shifts the previous queue downwards
* *Save & Close* button saved the changes made in this dialog. The changes include queue renaming and deletions
