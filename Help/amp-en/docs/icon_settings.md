# Icon settings

The icon settings allows to specify colors for specified UI images and change the images via the dialog.

The colors use the color settings as default but they can be reselected along with the image selection. The icons must be Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) images and they are stored in a *icons.json* file in the [local data folder](data_storing.md).

Icon should be in 1:1 aspect ratio for normal icons. For value indicator images on sliders the aspect ratio should be 1:2.

**NOTE:** in the *macOS* operating system the icons are not displayed in the software menu.
